    "# Attention please!\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebooks tries to establish a brief introduction to **attention** in deep neural nets. Attention establishes a mechanism that allows a model to make predictions based on selectively attending to different items of an input sequence. It can be employed as a pretty generic modeling layer for problems with a sequential structure (and beyond).\n",
    "\n",
    "Attention has been developed in language processing [[Bahdanau et al., 2015](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.0473); [Luong et al., 2015](https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.04025)]. The **transformer architecture** from the *Attention Is All You Need*-paper [[Vaswani et al., 2017](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762)] is seen as a breakthrough in this field. It overcomes some shortcomings of recurrent neural networks. The **vision transformer** [[Dosovitskiy et al., 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11929)] applies self-attention to tokenized image patches. Current reviews of different attention variants are provided in [[Brauwers and Frasincar, 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.14263); [Lin et al., 2022](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aiopen.2022.10.001)]."

    "Beyond that, another motivation of masking is to reduce the computational complexity. The global all-to-all attention suffers from a $\\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ time and memory complexity ($n$ is the sequence length). In order to enable long context lengths, one may restrict the attention to local neighborhoods of each token through a **sliding windows** scheme [[Beltagy et al., 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.05150)]. This reduces the complexity to $\\mathcal{O}(n \\cdot w)$ (the window size is denoted as $w$).\n",

A **shifted windows** partitioning scheme for the ViT has been presented in [[Liu et al., 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.14030)]. It limits self-attention to non-overlapping windows, while it still allows for certain cross-window connections. This approach features a complexity that is only linear in the image size."
